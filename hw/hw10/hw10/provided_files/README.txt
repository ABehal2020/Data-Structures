COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
n = number of elements in the input
f = requested number of values in output (first sorted only)
l = maximum length of any string element

Neatly fill in the table below with the Big O Notation for running time.

RESULTS
For each data type and each operation, run several sufficiently large
tests and collect the operation time output by the program. Organize
these timing measurements in your README.txt file and estimate the
coefficients for the dominant term of your Big ‘O’ Notation.

< insert your performance measurements and coefficient estimates >




DISCUSSION
Do these measurements and the overall performance match your predicted
Big ‘O‘ Notation for the data type and operation? Did you update your
initial answers for the Big ‘O‘ Notation of any cell in the table?

Compare the relative coefficients for different data types that have
the same Big ‘O’ Notation for a specific operation. Do these match
your intuition? Are you surprised by any of the results? Will these
results impact your data structure choices for future programming
projects?

Use well-written, complete sentences.  Approximately 250-500 words.
